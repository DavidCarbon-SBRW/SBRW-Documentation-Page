# Hosting a CDN

**Since EA had officially removed the game files from their own servers. This means we can no longer use their CDN to download the game, but thankfully DavidCarbon had made a copy of the server files to create a new CDN!**

## Downloading the Packed Game Files

Download the Compressed Game Files to your local Machine or Web Server.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure to unzip the files to a location with at least 5GB of Storage Space
{% endhint %}

 ðŸ’¾ [Download](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=17j5-yga6PHWsxnmqJImMBTyYmFK8qzzu)

{% hint style="info" %}
By default the folder is _ea\_nfsw\_section_ but can be changed to a different folder name.
{% endhint %}

### **Please Note**

**If hosting the compressed Game Files for the Game\_Launcher, your Web Server will see a rough Average of 3-5 TB of Bandwith per month. Please make sure to check with your Hosting Provider to have enough Bandwith for such Traffic, especially during High Peak Hours.**
