# Access Violation

**Access Violation 0xc0000005** error is caused by your computer not being able to correctly process the files & settings that it requires to run a particular program or installation. Despite the error showing when you try and use particular pieces of software, or when you try and upgrade Windows, it has many different causes including the likes of faulty RAM problems, errors with the files of your PC and issues with the settings of your PC

#### **1. Recommended Method**

A popular method of repairing game files is simply reinstalling. To do this, you must first disable antivirus software as well as Windows Defender. Clear all game and launcher files, and then download the launcher from the [Download section \(click here\)](../../installation/official-launcher/) for the current version of _**GameLauncher**_. Unpack to folder, then run the launcher as an administrator and follow the installer, then wait before the game files are not downloaded.

#### **2.** _****_**Alternative Method**

Download Need for Speed World File Validator in the [Settings section \(click here\)](https://docs.sbrw.davidcarbon.download/launcher/settings/official/misc#disable-process-that-validate-files) and place this file in the folder with Need for Speed World files \(most often \`GameFiles\`\) and run it. After starting, press any key. Validation \(verification\) of files usually takes from 3 minutes to several \(depending on the condition of your computer\). The program after the validation returns the status, and if program encounters a problem with the file, program will replace it.

#### **3. System File Integrity**

The sfc /scannow command \(System File Checker\) scans the integrity of all protected Windows system files and replaces incorrect corrupted, changed/modified, or damaged versions with the correct versions if possible.  
 1. Right Click on the windows button and from there open command prompt with administrative rights.  
 2. Now in the cmd window type:

```text
sfc / scannow
```

3. Wait for the system file checker to finish
